· INTRODUCTION.

Two old Athenian citizens, DmPHo and CHREMES, brothers, have left Athens, the
former to go to Cilicia, the· latter to Lemnos. On departing they placed their sons,
named respectively AN‘rn’Ho and PfflnmuA, in charge of DEMlPHo's slave GE'rA. The
ostensible object of CHREMES’S journey to Lemnos was to collect the rents of some estates
owned there by his rich {vise NAUSISTRATA3 his real purpose to bring back with him to
Athens a young girl, PHANIUM, his daughter by a second wife whom he has secretly
married, under the name of STILPQ in one of his previous visits to that island. It has
been previously arranged between the two old men that the girl on her arrival shall be
married to ΑΝἮΡΗΟ, and they hope to carry out this plan m such a way that no suspicion
shall arise in Athens as to her parentage. Here begins the action of the play, while the
fathers are still absent. · ·
