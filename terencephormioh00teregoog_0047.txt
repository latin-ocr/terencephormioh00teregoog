iv.6.12.] PHORMIO. 45

reception at the hands of her father-indam is recognized by CHREMES as the nurse of
his daughter Prummu. She addresses him as STILPO, under which name he had
passed at Lemnos 3 whereupon he explains to her in low tones the mystery of his
double marriage. He asks after his second wife and daughter 3 and on hearing that
it is PHANIUM to whom ΑΝΤΙΡΗΟ is married, expresses his satisfaction at the unex-
pected accomplishment of his life-long wish‚ but begs SOP31RONA to keep the matter

quiet, that his Athenian wife may suspect nothing.

[Enter SOPHRONA from DEMlpno’S house. Soliloquizes, not perceiving
CHREMES]
