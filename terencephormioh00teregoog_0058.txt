PHORMIO soliloquizes over the good fortune of the young men, and determines to make
use of his knowledge of CHREMES’S guilty secret in such a way as to prevent the old
men from demanding back the money paid him3 thus PHAEDRIA will be freed from
the necessity of borrowing from his friends.

SCENE 8.

The two old men inform PHORMIO that they have changed their minds on the subject
of his marrying PHANIUM, and beg him to consider the matter at an end, and to refund
the money paid him. On his refusal they threaten to go to law on the subject3 where-
upon PHORMIO starts off to inform NAUSISTRATA of her husband's second marriage.
They endeavor to hold him back, and a struggle ensues upon the stage.
