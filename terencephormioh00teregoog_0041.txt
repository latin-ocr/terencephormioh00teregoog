Gru informs the old men that he has concluded an arrangement by which they can get

rid of the unwelcome bride. PHORMIO, though pretending to be betrothed to a rich
girl. has consented, in order to avoid further quarrels‚ to marry the stranger, is they
will give him along with her sufficient dowry to pay his debts. He names thirty
minae, the sum required by PHAEDRIA. Dmm‘no refuses ς but CHREMES, in his eager-
neu for the arrangement, consents to pay the money out of his own pocket. AN‘m’Ho
is present unobserved during the interview and naturally considers himself betrayed
by Gru.
