PREFACE.

——-

Tms edition of the Pnommo, while prepared especially to meet the

needs of the Freshman Latin Classes in HARVARD COLLEGE, will, it is ,

hoped, be found useful in other institutions where attention is given to
sight-reading.
With the exception of a few minor changes in punctuation, the text
of CARL Dzm‘rzxo (Leipzig, 1884) has been followed without deviation.
My thanks are due to Pnor. J. Β. GREENOUGH for valuable suggestions,
and to Pnor. J. C. Ram, of the Umvmzsrrv or MlcchN, for assistance

in proof-reading. FRANK w NICOLSON
