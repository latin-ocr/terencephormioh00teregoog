From Glmi’s conversation with Davus it appears (1) that Plutum ia in love with a
music-girl owned by DORIO, but is unable to buy her for want of meanz (a) that
ΑΝΤΙΡΗΟ, having fallen in love with a beautiful stranger, an orphan, has been enabled to
marry her through the machinatione of a Parasite, Puonno by name, who, taking
advantage of a law at Athens which compels the next os kin of a female orphan either
to marry her or to give her a dowry, and pretending to be a friend of the giri’a family,
has by process of law compelled ΑΝΤΙΡΗΟ to ved her. A letter has been received
announcing the speedy return of ΒΕΜῙΡΗΟ, to which event GrrA looks forward with
much apprehension.
