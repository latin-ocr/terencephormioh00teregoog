SCENE 9.

NAUSISTRATA enters, summoned by the calls of PHORMIO, who proceeds to inform her, in
spite of the efforts of the old men to prevent him, of her husband's second marriage.
DEMIPHO craves pardon for his brother on the ground of his youthfulness at the time
of committing the fault. . As,NAus1srRA1-A is on the point of granting it, PHORMIO
tells her of the money he has obtained from her husband, and given, unknown to him,
to her son, to secure his marriage with his mistress. NAUSISTRATA silences her hus-
band's objections by recalling his own faultS, and decides to withhold her decision
until she has seenvher son. PHORMIO applauds her resolution, and is rewarded for
his efforts by an invitation to dinner.
